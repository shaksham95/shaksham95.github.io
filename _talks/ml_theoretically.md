In this talk, I gave an overview of why having strong mathematical foundations in ML is not only helpful but necessary via three scenarios:-

1. By demonstrating the common misunderstanding, **"Correlation implies causation."**
2. Explained how **"correlation CAN imply causation."**
3. Showed the difference between sklearn implementation of Linear Regression and solving the same algorithm using just maths.
