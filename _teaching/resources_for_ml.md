- If you are starting your career in data science or are already working but facing issues while dealing with those big scary mathematical equations, then here are some of the resources which I have used and found extremely useful.
  
  - **Calculus**
    
    - [Part I](https://www.udemy.com/course/calculus1/)
    
    - [Part II](https://www.udemy.com/course/calculus-2/)
    
    - [Part III](https://www.udemy.com/course/calculus-3/)
  
  - **Linear Algebra**
    
    - [LAFF](https://www.edx.org/course/linear-algebra-foundations-to-frontiers)
  
  - [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-mathematics-of-machine-learning-894f046c568)



- If you are new to Python, then I would highly recommend this 5-course specialization offered by [University of Michigan](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)



- I like knowing things from inside out and to understand every aspect of an ML algorithm, I looked for resources that might help me and I found the following two resources very helpful.
  
  - [Lazy Programmer](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-linear-regression-in-python/) - Any course offered by this guy has good coverage of maths and is fun and enriching.
  
  - [ISLR](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/) - One of the best books that I have studied so far.
