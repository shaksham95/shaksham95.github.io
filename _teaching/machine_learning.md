- I like knowing things from inside out and to understand every aspect of an ML algorithm, I looked for resources that might help me and I found the following two resources very helpful.
  
  - [Lazy Programmer](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-linear-regression-in-python/) - Any course offered by this guy has good coverage of maths and is fun and enriching.
  
  - [ISLR](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/) - One of the best books that I have studied so far.
