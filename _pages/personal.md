When I'm not working, I have several hobbies.

- I enjoy gaming:-
  
  - **PC games:** Counter Strike - Global Offensive, Cricket revolution, NFS Series and Blur.
  
  - **Outdoor games:** Cricket and Badminton

- Reading (currently, I am reading the following books):-
  
  - [Brief Answers to the Big Questions](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07D2ZKPL2/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)
  
  - [We Have No Idea: A Guide to the Unknown Universe](https://www.amazon.in/We-Have-No-Idea-Universe/dp/0735211515)
  
  - [The Power of your Subconscious Mind](https://www.flipkart.com/power-your-subconscious-mind/p/itmfc599jmcfhhwm?pid=9788192910963&lid=LSTBOK9788192910963KRTISC&marketplace=FLIPKART&cmpid=content_book_8965229628_gmc_pla&tgi=sem,1,G,11214002,u,,,395332127672,,,,c,,,,,,,&ef_id=Cj0KCQiAxfzvBRCZARIsAGA7YMwVxF21TUZNvFdWhvNisnSnS9RMadxBFAVRmzulEwDJizH1DEkaw1IaAq00EALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!739!3!395332127672!!!u!295092701166!&gclid=Cj0KCQiAxfzvBRCZARIsAGA7YMwVxF21TUZNvFdWhvNisnSnS9RMadxBFAVRmzulEwDJizH1DEkaw1IaAq00EALw_wcB)

- Mentoring
  
  - When I started my journey in data science, I didn't have the luxury of having a mentor who can guide me and I know it's a tough experience when you are starting or planning to start your career in data science.
  
  - Hence, I started mentoring people like me who need someone to help them out and get their careers started in data science. So far, I have mentored dozens of national and international students/professionals in helping them kickstart their careers in data science.
