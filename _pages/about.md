I'm a Junior Data Scientist at Persistent (PSL). My research is to leverage NLP with knowledge graphs and analyze hate speech in the way we use language to express our opinions.

Here are some of the things I'm up to these days:

- Working on my research project (hate-speech analysis)
- Exploring deep learning
- Participating and giving sessions in NLP nd ML at our monthly data science meetups.
