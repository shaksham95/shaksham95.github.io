I'm a **Junior Data Scientist** at Persistent (PSL). My current research is to leverage NLP with knowledge graphs and analyze how we use hate speech patterns to express our opinions in the way we use language.



I believe that passion and diligence are the two keys to being successful in any endeavor that one setâ€™s their mind. I love to generate new ideas and devise feasible solutions to broadly relevant problems. I enjoy embracing the lessons learned from failure, stand up and continue to grow.



Here are some of the things I'm up to these days:

- Working on my research project (hate-speech analysis)
- Exploring deep learning
- Participating and giving talks on NLP nd ML at our monthly data science meetups.
